This source code comprises a simple web service for
assisting in the play of
[The Glass Plate Game](http://glassplategame.com) between
multiple players across the Internet. Most of the code is
client-side JavaScript, but there's enough PHP to glue it to
a database for tracking and sharing moves among the players.

This code is still pre-alpha. The current largest deficiency
is problems translating coordinates of moves in the game
among screens of varying sizes.

The source code is available under the GPL v3. Please see
the file COPYING in this distribution for license terms.

The card images and text are, for now, not licensed for
general use. If you want to use them, please contact me so
that we can reach an agreement. I am really interested in
seeing this work shared, so I'm sure we can work something
out.
